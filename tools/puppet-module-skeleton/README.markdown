# puppet module skeleton
## Better templates for puppet-module-tool

As a feature, puppet module tool will use ~/.puppet/var/puppet-module/skeleton
as template for its `generate` command. The files provided here are meant to be
better templates for use with the puppet module tool.

Also, puppetlabs_spec_helper is featureful but cumbersome to start with
comparing to what `rspec-puppet-init` provides for rspec-puppet. So when
creating a new module with the template, it will generate automatically all
needed files to get started quickly.

This skeleton will provides:

- puppet-lint compliant files
- params, install, config and service classes templates
- puppetlabs_spec_helper's Rakefile, .fixtures.yml and spec_helper.rb
- basic spec/classes/ntp_spec.rb file to start with
- Same Modulefile and README than the one that comes with puppet

This will not replace the files that comes with the puppet module tool, but puppet module will only install the one you have in ~/.puppet/var/puppet-module/skeleton if you have this directory.

## Requirements

- puppet module tool (comes with puppet 2.7.14 or PE 2.5 and later)
- puppetlabs_spec_helper gem
- rake

## Optional requirements

- puppet-lint

## Installation

As we don't want to have our .git files and this README in our skeleton, we
export it like this:

    git clone https://github.com/spiette/puppet-module-skeleton 
    cd puppet-module-skeleton
    rake install

## Usage

    puppet module generate user-ntp

The output should be:

    Generating module at .../user-ntp
    user-ntp
    user-ntp/.fixtures.yml
    user-ntp/Rakefile
    user-ntp/manifests
    user-ntp/manifests/config.pp
    user-ntp/manifests/init.pp
    user-ntp/manifests/install.pp
    user-ntp/manifests/params.pp
    user-ntp/manifests/service.pp
    user-ntp/spec
    user-ntp/spec/classes
    user-ntp/spec/classes/ntp_spec.rb
    user-ntp/spec/spec_helper.rb
    user-ntp/tests
    user-ntp/tests/init.pp

## Then?

Then, run rake, and get the puppetlabs_spec_helper bliss. Feel free to fork and adapt it to your liking.
